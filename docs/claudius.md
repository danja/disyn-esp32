 using /home/danny/github/disyn-esp32 for reference, create a whole new synth voice module. It will be on the  
  same hardware, see /home/danny/github/disyn-esp32/docs/requirements.md It should include controls for         
  attack and decay, so it can be used as a complete voice module. It should have a pitch control on one CV and  
  knob. Everything else is up to you, be creative! Make it interesting! Create the project in
