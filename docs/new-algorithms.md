# New algorithms

Unless otherwise stated, pitch should be governed by the CV & knob input as with existing algorithms.
If a second output isn't specified, think of something simple to put in place.

## Sine

Simple sine wave

Param1 : quantization

## Ramp

Param1 : quantization

## Triangle

Param1 : quantization

## Pulse

Param1 : pulse width

## Noise

Pseudo-random noise varied by pitch so it goes from low frequency up to quasi-white noise

Param1 : smoothing (simple filter)

## Logistic

logistic map based chaotic signal

from low frequency (so it can be used as a modulating LFO) up to AF

Param1 : smoothing (simple slew filter)

## Butterfly

Chaotic signal governed by Lorenz equations

from low frequency (so it can be used as a modulating LFO) up to AF

Param1 : smoothing (simple slew filter)

Two outputs.
