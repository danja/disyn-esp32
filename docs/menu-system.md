# Menu System

Rotary controller with switch.

Each menu page contains a list of items. Pressing the switch moves to the next item, returning to the first item after clicking on the last. The behaviour on moving the rotary controller is determined by the currently selected item.   

Most items will be parameters with a variable value that can be changed by rotating the encoder. But the top, title, line of a menu page when selected, gives access to other menu pages by rotating the controller. Clicking the switch when in that position allows paging. Clicking the title line on the last page cycles back to the first page.
